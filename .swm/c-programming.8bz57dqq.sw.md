### History of C Programming

The history of the C programming language is rich and fascinating, reflecting the evolution of programming itself. Here’s a detailed overview of the key milestones in the development of C:

#### **Origins in the 1960s**

- **BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language)**: In the late 1960s, BCPL was developed by Martin Richards at the University of Cambridge. It was one of the first programming languages designed for writing system software and influenced later languages.

- **B Language**: In 1969, Ken Thompson, a computer scientist at Bell Labs, developed the B programming language as an evolution of BCPL. B was designed for system programming and was used primarily for writing operating systems.

#### **Development of C in the Early 1970s**

- **C Language Creation**: In 1972, Dennis Ritchie, also at Bell Labs, developed C as an evolution of the B language. C was designed to provide low-level access to memory and system resources, making it suitable for system programming tasks, particularly for the Unix operating system.

- **Unix Operating System**: C was originally created for developing the Unix operating system. The flexibility and efficiency of C made it a natural choice for system programming, leading to the widespread adoption of C in Unix development.

#### **S**tandardization and Evolution (1970s - 1980s)

- **The First C Book**: In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the book "The C Programming Language," which became known as K&R C. This book served as the definitive reference for the language and helped popularize C programming.

- **C89 Standardization**: By the late 1970s and early 1980s, the C language became popular, and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) initiated a project to standardize C. In 1989, the ANSI C standard (also known as C89 or C90) was published. This version introduced new features such as function prototypes, the `const` and `volatile` qualifiers, and standard library headers.

#### **Int**ernational Standardization (1990s)

- **ISO C**: In 1990, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted the ANSI C standard as ISO 9899:1990, also known as C90. This standardized C for international use.

- **C99 Standardization**: In 1999, a new version of the C standard, known as C99, was released. C99 introduced several new features, including:

  - New data types like `long long int` for extended integer representation.

  - Support for inline functions and variable-length arrays.

  - New library functions and macros, such as `snprintf`.

#### **Modern Developments (2000s - Present)**

- **C11 Standardization**: In December 2011, the C11 standard was released (ISO/IEC 9899:2011). C11 introduced several features aimed at improving the language's usability and security, including:

  - Improved support for multi-threading with the `<threads.h>` library.

  - An optional type generic macro.

  - Static assertions to enforce certain conditions at compile time.

- **C18 Standardization**: In June 2018, the C18 standard (ISO/IEC 9899:2018) was published. C18 primarily focused on bug fixes and clarifications from C11, with no significant new features.

- **C23 Standardization**: A new version of the C standard, known as C23, is currently in development, aiming to introduce more features and enhancements. It is expected to provide additional libraries and improvements to existing features.

#### **L**egacy and Impact

- **Widespread Adoption**: C has had a profound influence on many modern programming languages, including C++, C#, Java, Python, and many others. Its syntax and concepts have become foundational in the field of programming.

- **Applications**: C remains widely used for system programming, embedded systems, operating systems, compilers, and performance-critical applications. Its efficiency and control over system resources make it a preferred choice for various domains.

- **Community and Ecosystem**: C has a robust ecosystem of compilers, libraries, and tools. Various compilers, such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), Clang, and Microsoft Visual C++, support C programming.

The history of C programming reflects its evolution from a language designed for system programming to one that has shaped the software development landscape. C's efficiency, performance, and versatility have secured its place as one of the most important and enduring programming languages in the history of computing.

### Basic Structure of a C Program

The basic structure of a C program consists of several key components that work together to create a functional program. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

```c
#include <stdio.h> // Preprocessor directive

// Function declaration
int main() { // Main function
    // Variable declaration
    int number;
    
    // Executable statements
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);
    printf("You entered: %d\n", number);
    
    // Return statement
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Preprocessor Directives**

- These lines begin with `#` and are processed before the actual compilation of the code begins.

- Example: `#include <stdio.h>` tells the compiler to include the standard input-output header file, which contains functions like `printf` and `scanf`.

#### **Global Decla**rations

- Variables and functions declared outside of any function have a global scope and can be accessed from any part of the program.

- Global declarations are not shown in the basic example above but are common in larger programs.

#### **The** `main` Function

- This is the entry point of every C program. Execution starts from the `main` function.

- Syntax: `int main() { /* code */ }`

- The `main` function returns an integer value, typically `0` to indicate successful execution.

**Variable Declarations**

- Variables must be declared before they are used.

- Example: `int number;` declares an integer variable named `number`.

**Executable Statements**

- These are the instructions that the program executes.

- Examples include input/output functions, arithmetic operations, and function calls.

- `printf("Enter a number: ");` displays a message to the user.

- `scanf("%d", &number);` reads an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable `number`.

#### **Return** Statement

- The `return` statement in the `main` function returns control to the operating system.

- `return 0;` indicates that the program ended successfully.

&nbsp;

### Variable Declaration and Initialization

**Declaration :** Specifying the type and name of a variable.

```c
int a;
float b;
char c;
```

**Initialization** : Assigning an initial value to a variable at the time of declaration.

```c
int a = 10;
float b = 3.14;
char c = 'A';
```

### **Data Types and Variables**

Data types specify the type of data that a variable can hold. C has several basic data types, and each type determines the amount of memory allocated to a variable and the kind of operations that can be performed on it.

#### Integer Types

`short int` used to store smaller integer values. Typically occupies `2 bytes`.

```c
short int b = 5;
```

`int` used to store integer values (whole numbers). Typically occupies `4 bytes` of memory.

```c
int a = 10;
```

`long int` used to store larger integer values. Typically occupies `4 or 8 bytes`.

```c
long int c = 100000L;
```

`long long int` used to store very large integer values. Typically occupies `8 bytes`.

```c
long long int d = 10000000000LL;
```

#### Character Type

`char` used to store single characters. Typically occupies `1 byte`.

```c
char e = 'A';
```

#### Floating-Point Types

`float` used to store single-precision floating-point numbers. Typically occupies `4 bytes`.

```c
float f = 3.14f;
```

`double` used to store double-precision floating-point numbers. Typically occupies `8 bytes`.

```c
double g = 3.14159;
```

`long double` used to store extended precision floating-point numbers. Typically occupies `10, 12, or 16 bytes`.

```c
long double h = 3.141592653589793L;
```

### Other Datatypes

**Arrays** is a collection of elements of the same type.

```c
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

**Pointers** is variable that stores the address of another variable.

```c
int *ptr;
int x = 10;
ptr = &x;
```

**Structures** is collection of variables of different types.

```c
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float salary;
};
```

**Unions** is similar to structures but members share the same memory location.

```c
union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
    char str[20];
};
```

**Enums** is user-defined data type consisting of named integer constants.

```c
enum Week {Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday};
```

**String**

In C, there is no specific data type called `string`. Instead, strings are represented as arrays of characters terminated by a null character (`\0`). This null character marks the end of the string.

```c
char str[50];  // A string can hold up to 49 characters + null terminator
```

Strings can be initialized in several ways

```c
char str1[] = "Hello, World!";  // The size of the array is determined by the length of the string
char str2[50] = "Hello, World!";  // Specifying the size of the array explicitly
char str3[50] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};  // Character array with a null terminator
```

**Signed and Unsigned Datatypes**

- **signed**: Can hold both positive and negative values (default for `int` and `char`).

```c
signed int si = -10;
```

- **unsigned**: Can hold only positive values.

```c
unsigned int ui = 10;
```

&nbsp;

### Format Specifiers for Data Types in C

- **Integer Types**: `%hd` (short int), `%d` (int), `%ld` (long int), `%lld` (long long int)
- **Character Type**: `%c` (char)
- **Floating-Point Types**: `%f` (float), `%lf` (double), `%Lf` (long double)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Integer Types
    short int shortInt = 5;
    int intValue = 10;
    long int longInt = 100000L;
    long long int longLongInt = 10000000000LL;

    // Character Type
    char charValue = 'A';

    // Floating-Point Types
    float floatValue = 3.14f;
    double doubleValue = 3.14159;
    long double longDoubleValue = 3.141592653589793L;

    // Displaying all values with their format specifiers
    printf("Short int: %hd\n", shortInt);
    printf("Int: %d\n", intValue);
    printf("Long int: %ld\n", longInt);
    printf("Long long int: %lld\n", longLongInt);

    printf("Char: %c\n", charValue);

    printf("Float: %f\n", floatValue);
    printf("Double: %lf\n", doubleValue);
    printf("Long double: %Lf\n", longDoubleValue);

    return 0;
}
```

    printf("Comma operator result: %d\n", x); // Output: 15
    return 0;
}
```

&nbsp;

### Conditional statements

Conditional statements in C allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. Here's a list of conditional statements in C with brief descriptions:

`if` **statement**: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

`if-else` **statement**: Executes one block of code if a condition is true, and another if it's false.

`else if` **statement**: Allows checking multiple conditions in sequence.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;
    
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);
    
    if (number > 0) {
        printf("The number is positive.\n");
    } else if (number < 0) {
        printf("The number is negative.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The number is zero.\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

`Nested if` **statements**: Conditional statements inside other conditional statements.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age;
    char hasLicense;
    
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);
    
    printf("Do you have a driver's license? (Y/N): ");
    scanf(" %c", &hasLicense);
    
    if (age >= 18) {
        if (hasLicense == 'Y' || hasLicense == 'y') {
            printf("You are eligible to drive.\n");
        } else {
            printf("You are old enough, but need a license to drive.\n");
        }
    } else {
        if (age >= 16) {
            printf("You can apply for a learner's permit.\n");
        } else {
            printf("You are too young to drive.\n");
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

`switch` **statement**: Selects one of many code blocks to be executed based on a variable's value.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int day;
    
    printf("Enter a number (1-7): ");
    scanf("%d", &day);
    
    switch (day) {
        case 1:
            printf("Monday\n");
            break;
        case 2:
            printf("Tuesday\n");
            break;
        case 3:
            printf("Wednesday\n");
            break;
        case 4:
            printf("Thursday\n");
            break;
        case 5:
            printf("Friday\n");
            break;
        case 6:
            printf("Saturday\n");
            break;
        case 7:
            printf("Sunday\n");
            break;
        default:
            printf("Invalid day number\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

`Ternary operator`  is a shorthand way to write simple if-else statements.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age;
    
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);
    
    char* status = (age >= 18) ? "adult" : "minor";
    
    printf("You are an %s.\n", status);
    
    return 0;
}
```

`goto` **statement**: Jumps to a labeled statement within the function (use with caution).

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 0;
    
start:
    printf("%d ", i);
    i++;
    
    if (i < 5)
        goto start;
    
    printf("\nLoop finished.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

&nbsp;

### **Loop statement**&nbsp;

in C allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly

`for` loop: The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a block of code.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", i);
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```

`while` loop: The while loop executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 1;
    while (i <= 5) {
        printf("%d ", i);
        i++;
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```

`do-while` loop: The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block is executed at least once before the condition is checked.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 1;
    do {
        printf("%d ", i);
        i++;
    } while (i <= 5);
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Each type of loop has its use cases:

- Use `for` when you know the number of iterations in advance.

- Use `while` when you want to continue as long as a condition is true.

- Use `do-while` when you want to ensure the loop body executes at least once.

### Arrays

Arrays in C are a fundamental data structure that allow you to store multiple elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Let's dive into the details with explanations and examples.

1. Declaration and Initialization:

```c
// Declaration
int numbers[5];  // Array of 5 integers

// Declaration and initialization
int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  // Size is inferred
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  // Explicitly sized
int numbers[5] = {1, 2};  // Remaining elements initialized to 0
```

2. Accessing Elements: Array elements are accessed using their `index`, starting from 0:

```c
int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
printf("%d\n", numbers[2]);  // Prints 30
numbers[1] = 25;  // Modifies the second element
```

3. Multi-dimensional Arrays:

```c
int matrix[3][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
printf("%d\n", matrix[1][2]);  // Prints 6
```

4. Array Size: The size of an array can be determined using the sizeof operator:

```c
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int size = sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0]);
printf("Array size: %d\n", size);  // Prints 5
```

5. Arrays and Pointers: Arrays are closely related to pointers in C:
