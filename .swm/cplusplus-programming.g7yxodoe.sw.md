**C++** is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a **compiled** language.&nbsp;

1. C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for system and application programming. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language. C++ is an object-oriented, multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, functional, and generic programming styles.

2. One of the key features of C++ is its ability to support low-level, system-level programming, making it suitable for developing operating systems, device drivers, and other system software. At the same time, C++ also provides a rich set of libraries and features for high-level application programming, making it a popular choice for developing desktop applications, video games, and other complex applications.

3. C++ has a large, active community of developers and users, and a wealth of resources and tools available for learning and using the language. Some of the key features of C++ include:

4. Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create classes and objects and to define methods and properties for these objects.

5. Templates: C++ templates allow developers to write generic code that can work with any data type, making it easier to write reusable and flexible code.

6. Standard Template Library (STL): The STL provides a wide range of containers and algorithms for working with data, making it easier to write efficient and effective code.

7. Exception Handling: C++ provides robust exception handling capabilities, making it easier to write code that can handle errors and unexpected situations.

Overall, C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used for a range of applications and is well-suited for both low-level system programming and high-level application development.

### **Applicat**ions of C++

C++ finds varied usage in applications such as:

- Operating Systems & Systems Programming. e.g. *Linux-based OS (Ubuntu etc.)*

- Browsers *(Chrome & Firefox)*

- Graphics & Game engines *(Photoshop, Blender, Unreal-Engine)*

- Database Engines *(MySQL, MongoDB, Redis etc.)*

- Cloud/Distributed Systems

&nbsp;

### History of C++

The C++ programming language has a history going back to 1979, when `Bjarne Stroustrup` was doing work for his Ph.D. thesis. One of the languages Stroustrup had the opportunity to work with was a language called Simula, which as the name implies is a language primarily designed for simulations. The Simula 67 language - which was the variant that Stroustrup worked with - is regarded as the first language to support the object-oriented programming paradigm. Stroustrup found that this paradigm was very useful for software development, however the Simula language was far too slow for practical use.

#### **Here are some awesome facts about C++ that may interest you:**&nbsp;

 1. The name of C++ signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C. “++” is the C increment operator.&nbsp;

 2. C++ is one of the predominant languages for the development of all kinds of technical and commercial software.&nbsp;

 3. C++ introduces Object-Oriented Programming, not present in C. Like other things, C++ supports the four primary features of OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and inheritance.&nbsp;

 4. C++ got the OOP features from Simula67 Programming language.&nbsp;

 5. A function is a minimum requirement for a C++ program to run.&nbsp;

 6. C and C++ have invented in the same place i.e. at AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph) bell laboratories, located in the U.S.A.&nbsp;

 7. Not purely object-oriented: We can write C++ code without using classes and it will compile without showing any error message. The language has some extensions over C, that make OOP and generic programming more convenient.&nbsp;

 8. Many programming languages are influenced by c++, some of which include C#, Java, and even newer versions of C.&nbsp;

 9. Concept of reference variables: operator overloading borrowed from Algol 68 programming language.&nbsp;

10. A major reason behind the success of C++ is that it supports various programming styles.

11. &nbsp;It is a multiparadigm programming language that not only supports the OOP paradigm but also many other paradigms.

| C was developed by Dennis Ritchie between the year 1969 and 1973 at AT&T Bell Labs.                                             | C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979.                                                                                                |
| C does no support polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance which means that C does not support object oriented programming. | C++ supports polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance because it is an object oriented programming language.                               |
| C is (mostly) a subset of C++.                                                                                                  | C++ is (mostly) a superset of C.                                                                                                               |

| For the development of code, C supports procedural programming.                                                                 | C++ is known as hybrid language because C++ supports both procedural and object oriented programming paradigms.                                |
| Data and functions are separated in C because it is a procedural programming language.                                          | Data and functions are encapsulated together in form of an object in C++.                                                                      |

### C++ Hello World Program

```c++
// C++ program to display "Hello World"

// Header file for input output functions
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Main() function: where the execution of
// program begins
int main()
{
	// Prints hello world
	cout << "Hello World";

	return 0;
}
```

#### 1\. // Comments

This line is a comment line. A comment is used to display additional information about the program. A comment does not contain any programming logic.

When a comment is encountered by a compiler, the compiler simply skips that line of code. Any line beginning with ‘//’ without quotes OR in between /\*…\*/ in C++ is a comment.

#### 2\. `#include`

This is a preprocessor directive. The `#include` directive tells the compiler to include the content of a file in the source code.

For example, `#include<iostream>` tells the compiler to include the standard iostream file which contains declarations of all the standard input/output library functions.&nbsp;

### 3\. `using namespace std`

This is used to import the entity of the std namespace into the current namespace of the program. The statement using namespace std is generally considered a bad practice. When we import a namespace we are essentially pulling all type definitions into the current scope.

The std namespace is huge. The alternative to this statement is to specify the namespace to which the identifier belongs using the scope operator(`::`) each time we declare a type. For example, `std::cout`.

#### 4\. `int main() { }`

A function is a group of statements that are designed to perform a specific task. The main() function is the entry point of every C++ program, no matter where the function is located in the program.

The opening braces ‘{‘ indicates the beginning of the main function and the closing braces ‘}’ indicates the ending of the main function.

#### 5\. `cout<<“Hello World”;`

std::cout is an instance of the `std::ostream` class, that is used to display output on the screen. Everything followed by the character << in double quotes ” ” is displayed on the output device. The semi-colon character at the end of the statement is used to indicate that the statement is ending there

#### 6\. `return 0`

This statement is used to return a value from a function and indicates the finishing of a function. This statement is basically used in functions to return the results of the operations performed by a function.

#### 7\. Indentation

As you can see the cout and the return statement have been indented or moved to the right side. This is done to make the code more readable. We must always use indentations and comments to make the code more readable.

#### 8\. Important Points

1. Always include the necessary header files for the smooth execution of functions. For example, `<iostream>` must be included to use `std::cin` and `std::cout`.

2. The execution of code begins from the `main()` function.

3. It is a good practice to use **Indentation** and **comments** in programs for easy understanding.

4. `cout` is used to print statements and `cin` is used to take inputs.

&nbsp;

### **Types of Variables**

There are three types of variables based on the scope of variables in C++

#### **1. Local Variables**

Local variables are declared inside a function or a block (e.g., a loop or an if statement) and can only be used within that function or block. Once the function or block completes execution, the local variables are destroyed and their memory is deallocated.

**Scope**: Limited to the function or block in which they are declared.

**Lifetime**: Exists only during the execution of the block or function.

```c++
#include <iostream>

void exampleFunction() {
    int localVar = 10;  // Local variable
    std::cout << "Local Variable: " << localVar << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    exampleFunction();
    // std::cout << localVar << std::endl;  // Error: localVar is not accessible here
    return 0;
}
```

#### 2\. Instance Variables

instance variables refer to member variables of a class (also known as fields or attributes). Each object of a class has its own copy of instance variables.

**Scope**: Throughout the class in which they are defined. They can be accessed using the object of the class.

**Lifetime**: Exists as long as the object of the class exists.

```c++
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    int instanceVar;  // Instance variable

    void display() {
        std::cout << "Instance Variable: " << instanceVar << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1;
    obj1.instanceVar = 5;
    obj1.display();

    MyClass obj2;
    obj2.instanceVar = 10;
    obj2.display();

    return 0;
}
```

#### 3\. Global Variables

**Definition**: Global variables are declared outside of all functions and classes, typically at the top of the file. These variables can be accessed by any function or block within the program, providing a way to share data across multiple parts of the code.

**Scope**: Global variables have a scope that extends from the point of declaration to the end of the program, making them accessible throughout the entire program unless overshadowed by a local variable with the same name within a specific function or block.

**Lifetime**: Global variables exist for the duration of the program, meaning they are allocated when the program starts and deallocated when the program ends.

```c++
#include <iostream>

// Global variable
int globalVar = 20;

void exampleFunction() {
    // Accessing the global variable
    std::cout << "Global Variable in Function: " << globalVar << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    // Accessing the global variable
    std::cout << "Global Variable in Main: " << globalVar << std::endl;
    exampleFunction();
    // Modifying the global variable
    globalVar = 50;
    std::cout << "Modified Global Variable in Main: " << globalVar << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### 4\. Static Variables

Static variables are associated with the class rather than any object. There is only one copy of a static variable shared among all objects of the class. In the context of functions, a static variable retains its value across function calls.

**Scope**: Within the class or function where they are declared.

**Lifetime**: Exists for the duration of the program.

**Example** (Class-level static variable):

```c++
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    static int staticVar;  // Static variable

    static void display() {
        std::cout << "Static Variable: " << staticVar << std::endl;
    }
};

// Definition and initialization of the static variable
int MyClass::staticVar = 0;

int main() {
    MyClass::staticVar = 5;
    MyClass::display();

    MyClass obj;
    obj.staticVar = 10;
    obj.display();  // Same static variable, value updated

    return 0;
}
```

**Example** (Function-level static variable):

```c++
#include <iostream>

void incrementCounter() {
    static int counter = 0;  // Static local variable
    counter++;
    std::cout << "Counter: " << counter << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    incrementCounter();  // Output: 1
    incrementCounter();  // Output: 2
    incrementCounter();  // Output: 3

    return 0;
}
```

#### Summary

- **Local Variables**: Declared within a function/block, destroyed after function/block execution.

- **Instance Variables**: Declared in a class, unique to each object.

- **Static Variables**: Associated with a class/function, persists throughout the program's life.

### C++ Constants

In C++, constants are fixed values that cannot be altered by the program during execution. They are used to prevent accidental modification of values that should remain unchanged throughout the program.

#### Types of Constants

**Literal Constants**:

- These are fixed values that are directly inserted into the code. They can be of various types, including integer, floating-point, character, and string literals.

```c++
42          // Integer literal
3.14        // Floating-point literal
'a'         // Character literal
"Hello"     // String literal
```

#### `const` Keyword:

- The `const` keyword is used to declare constants that cannot be modified after initialization.

- When you declare a variable as `const`, you must initialize it at the time of declaration.

```c++
const int maxValue = 100;
maxValue = 200;  // Error: Cannot modify a const variable
```

#### **Enumerations (**`enum`**):**

- Enumerations are a user-defined type consisting of a set of named integral constants.

- They are used to assign names to integral constants to make the code more readable.

```c++
enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE };
Color myColor = GREEN;
```

#### `constexpr` Keyword:

- The `constexpr` keyword is used to define constants that can be evaluated at compile time. This helps in optimizing the program.

```c++
constexpr int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int area = square(5);  // Computed at compile time
```

#### Advantages of Using Constants

- **Readability**: Constants make code easier to read and understand by giving meaningful names to fixed values.

- **Maintainability**: Constants allow you to manage changes more easily. If a constant value needs to be changed, you can do it in one place.

- **Safety**: Using constants helps prevent accidental changes to values that should remain unchanged, reducing bugs.

#### Using Constants in Different Contexts

**Global Constants**:

- Constants can be declared outside of all functions and classes, making them accessible throughout the program.

```c++
const double PI = 3.14159;

int main() {
    std::cout << "Value of PI: " << PI << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Class Constants**:

- Constants can be declared within a class. Use the `static` keyword for class-level constants to ensure a single instance across all objects.

```c++
class Circle {
public:
    static const double PI;
};

const double Circle::PI = 3.14159;

int main() {
    std::cout << "Circle PI: " << Circle::PI << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Function Parameters**:

- You can use the `const` keyword to prevent modification of function parameters, ensuring they are read-only within the function.

```c++
void display(const std::string& message) {
    // message cannot be modified
    std::cout << message << std::endl;
}
```

#### Summary

- **Constants** are fixed values that cannot change during program execution.

- They improve **readability**, **maintainability**, and **safety** of code.

- Use the `const` keyword to declare read-only variables.

- `constexpr` allows compile-time constant evaluation.

- **Enumerations** (`enum`) are used to create sets of named integral constants.

- Constants can be used globally, within classes, and as function parameters for better code management.
